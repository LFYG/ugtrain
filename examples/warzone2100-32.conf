# Maintainer: Sebastian Parschauer <s.parschauer@gmx.de>
#
# works adapted with 3.1~rc2, 3.1.0, 3.1.1
# works adapted with and without PIE + ASLR
# doesn't work with < 3.0, see warzone2100_238-32.conf

# $ ugtrain -P examples/warzone2100-32

# Here we hook on dynamic memory (C++ constructors) -
# multiple Droid and Structure objects. Also static memory
# is included.

### Guided Automatic Adaption for your System ###
# $ ugtrain -A examples/warzone2100-32
#
# If automatic adaption fails, try to run the adaption
# script with debugging or otherwise do full discovery!

# Please send the output to the following mailing list in this case:

### Discovery ###
# $ ugtrain -D "2" -S examples/warzone2100-32
# $ ugtrain -D "4;<size>" -S examples/warzone2100-32

# The body points are easy to find in memory.
# See doc/ugtrain-statmem.txt and doc/ugtrain-dynmem.txt for details!

# displayed in the droid design dialog.

# The game starts with 47 droids of which only 7 are our
# own droids. The memory object dump ('>' key during run)
# and the tool 'ugsimfind' are very useful here.

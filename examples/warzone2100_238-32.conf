# Here we hook on dynamic memory (C++ constructors) -
# multiple Droid and Structure objects. Also static memory
# is included.

### Guided Automatic Adaption for your System ###

# If automatic adaption fails, try to run the adaption
# script with debugging or otherwise do full discovery!

# The game starts with 47 droids of which only 7 are our
# own droids. The memory object dump ('>' key during run)
# and the tool 'ugsimfind' are very useful here.

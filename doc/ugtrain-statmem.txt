=== Static Memory Cheating ===

Cheating static memory is very easy. Between two game runs the memory value of
interest stays at the same memory location. In general this is everything which
is not stored on the heap or the stack.

All you need is the value name, absolute memory address, value type, wish
value, key bindings, the initial activation state and optional checks. The
checks are used for stability as in game main menu these could be on invalid
value or with a new game binary the location could have changed.

With a pure static memory config ugtrain attaches to the first running instance
of the game. So make sure it is running when calling "ugtrain <config>".
Otherwise, use the '-P' option to allow ugtrain to run it (recommended).
Looks like this: "ugtrain -P <config>"

The value is set to its wish value every second. Ugtrain uses the syscall
"ptrace" for that.

PLEASE NOTE: ptrace likely requires root permission if not called in the same
process group as the game. It even must be called in the parent. So letting
ugtrain run the game with -P makes much sense!


=== Static Memory Discovery ===

We always recommend the tool "scanmem" for static memory search. It uses
"ptrace" as well and is a very sophisticated CLI tool. If the value is
displayed the same way it is stored, it is easy to find it by entering its
value as numbers into scanmem until there is a single match.

If you are guessing that there is a static bool, then try to search for 0 for
false and 1 for true. It may take quite some cycles to reduce the number of
matches. C++ and standard C likely use the u8 datatype for bool but there is no
guarantee for that. If you only see a bar, then try the commands "snapshot",
"<", ">" and "=". If the bar decreases but you can't find it with "<", try the
inverse logic.

Please note that also scanmem likely requires root permission if not run in the
same process group as the game. This is why ugtrain supports running a process
group in the background consisting of scanmem and the game (-S option). As
scanmem must be the parent, this is some kind of chicken and egg problem.

And this is how it works:
fork() -> [fork() -> exec() game] -> sleep(3) -> exec() scanmem

It is possible that 3 seconds aren't long enough. So enter the "reset" command
on the scanmem command line as soon as you see the value you want to modify.
Scanmem reloads the known memory regions then.

Let's do an example with the "Power" in Warzone 2100 64-bit! In the versions
2.3.8 .. 3.1.1 it can be found as i32 as it is displayed at static location.

Discovery preparation:

Write the process name of the game into a config file. The PID is determined
from that and it must be located in the first line.

$ echo "warzone2100" > test.conf

Optional:

If the game is not in the PATH env. var., then we can add an absolute path but
it has to end with the process name.

$ echo "game_path /usr/games/bin/warzone2100" >> test.conf

Run the game and scanmem:

$ ugtrain -P -S test.conf

Start a new single-player campaign, look at the power bar!
Switch to scanmem and enter "reset"

0> reset

Enter the value of the power bar:

0> 1300

Now, in this case 784 matches are found. Build the HQ and
enter the new power value!

784> 1200

A single match? Man, we are lucky! List the matches,
set it to 5000 and build another building to verify that
we haven't just changed the display value!

1> list
[ 0]            0x10fb180, 1200, [I64 I32 I16 ]
1> set 0=5000
info: setting *0x10fb180 to 0x1388...

After building the research facility the value is at 4900. So we've
found the correct memory location.

With the scanmem "lregions" command we can see in which memory region
we are.

1> lregions
[ 0]   0x833000,  110592 bytes, rw-, /usr/games/warzone2100
[ 1]   0x84e000, 11223040 bytes, rw-, unassociated
[ 2]  0x1a0e000, 24252416 bytes, rw-, [heap]
...

We see that this address is too low to be on the heap or the stack. It is
marked as "unassociated".
Congratulations, we've found a static memory value! Close the game and type
"exit" on the scanmem command line!

We start watching it. Scanmem showed that i64, i32 and i16 are possible. In
general use the lowest possible data type! But when setting it to > 65535,
you'll see that i32 is possible.
Our new config looks like this:

warzone2100
Power 0x10fb180 i32 watch

We run it without -S:

$ ugtrain -P test.conf

Now, we see that it is 0 in main menu and 1300 upon campaign start. Now, we
would see the latest if it wouldn't be static.

It is okay to modify it and we only want to set it if it is lower than the
wish value and greater than 0 or a bit greater. Let's say 10. We want to
toggle it with the key '1' or '0' and it should be activated upon game start.

The new config looks like this:

warzone2100
Power 0x10fb180 i32 l 5000 1,0 a
check 0x10fb180 i32 g 10

This is all we need!
See examples/README for the complete config syntax.

=== Static Memory Adaption ===

Adapting static memory is quite difficult as the game code accesses it directly
without a library call. We need to set a memory breakpoint with a debugger like
"gdb" upon write to the found memory address. The moment the debugger halts the
game process, we dump the related assembly code. The difficulty is then to find
an unique similar code part in another binary of the game like different
compiler options, distribution or other game version. There we have to extract
the memory address it accesses. This address has to be set into the config
afterwards.

In most cases it is easier to do the discovery with scanmem again.

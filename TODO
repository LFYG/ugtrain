This tool is still under heavy development.
There is still a lot of work to do. We appreciate any help we can get.

Autotools:
+ create and include config.in and config.h

Config files:
+ make search paths for config files configurable
+ support static memory and memory allocations within a library (PIC)
+ provide separate config compatibility files (distribution, game version, ...)

Options:
+ support common linux options (-V, -v, -q, ...)
+ support option to enable external control

External control (using ugtrain as backend):
+ support config from stdin or command line

Multi-arch support:
+ support more CPU architectures than x86, x86_64 and ARM

Multi-platform support:
+ support Windows as well
+ write getch() functions for Windows
+ add Windows support for memory changing (OpenProcess, Read/WriteProcessMemory)
+ support MinGW compilation
+ implement arbitrary command execution helpers for Windows
+ add dyn. mem. support for Windows (Inline Hooking)
+ add dyn. mem. support for WINE (Inline Hooking)

Trainer:
+ support PIC in dynamic memory hacking and adaption (discovery works already)
+ support PIC for static memory
+ enhance support for growing memory objects (adaption, not only realloc(), ...)
+ add keys to disable all configured values and to enable all of them
    (we can only toggle values so far)
+ provide a key for getting help
+ provide a help text for all possible keys
+ support external control (start/stop locking values)

Testing:
+ implement (semi-)automatic testing with live-images and (3D enabled) VMs
+ implement options to stop execution at a certain point for unit testing

Demoing:
+ use live-images to demo ugtrain
+ record simple 2D games together with ugtrain to provide a set of tutorial videos
+ make ugtrain simpler and better usable

Documentation:
+ create man pages
+ implement an interactive tutorial tool "ugtutor" to use ugtrain step by step
+ let ugtutor detect installed games known to be working with ugtrain configs
+ rework the whole documentation (move details to an expert doc, hide complexity
  from beginners)

Other:
+ develop global config handling (/etc/ugtrain.conf, e.g. set preloading method)
+ create much more ugtrain configs for FOSS games
+ record more videos of ugtrain cheating at FOSS games and upload them to YouTube
+ fix the game capture tool "glc" to support pulseaudio capture correctly
+ further rework the ELF file growing algorihm in "patchelf".
+ evaluate "Cheat Engine" (source code) for Windows stuff

Roadmap:
0.4.0: Usability improvements
1.0.0: Full Linux support with a lot of configs for FOSS games
2.0.0: GUI frontend support
3.0.0: Windows support
4.0.0: WINE support

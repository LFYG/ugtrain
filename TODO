Version 0.2
This tool is still under heavy development. Dyn. mem. support is new.
There is still a lot of work to do. We appreciate any help we can get.

Autotools:
+ create and include config.in and config.h

Config files:
+ make search paths for config files configurable
+ support vector and list pointers to take over a dynamic structure in memory

Options:
+ support common linux options (-V, -v, ...)
+ support option to enable external control

External control (using ugtrain as backend):
+ support config from stdin or command line

Multi-platform support:
+ support Windows as well
+ write getch functions for Windows
+ add Windows support for memory changing (KeStackAttachProcess)
+ support mingw compilation
+ implement arbitrary command execution helpers for Windows
+ check boost libraries for help with that
+ add dyn. mem. support for Windows (Inline Hooking)
+ add dyn. mem. support for WINE (Inline Hooking)

Trainer:
+ support list and vector processing (hook 'memmove' as well)
+ support external control (start/stop freezing)
+ simplify dyn. mem. discovery and adaption

Documentation:
+ create man pages

Other:
+ record more videos of ugtrain cheating FOSS games and upload them to YouTube
+ evaluate "Cheat Engine" (source code) for Windows stuff

Roadmap:
0.2.1: All-you-can-cheat on Linux (a lot more configs)
0.3.0: Windows support
0.4.0: WINE support
0.5.0: GUI frontend support
